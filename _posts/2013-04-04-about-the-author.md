> "... un Aleph es uno de los puntos del espacio que contienen todos los puntos" Borges, El Aleph


Hi there! I'm Augusto. I consider myself a 'practitioner economist' with an interest in **macroeconomics and development**. I learned about **fiscal policy** while working at the Treasury of the Province of Santa Fe in Argentina. I then learned about **monetary and exchange rate policy** by working at the Central Bank of Argentina. Initially, working in the private sector in my family business helped me understand the **macro from the micro**. Living and working in Argentina was like living in a **real-time economic laboratory**. Some might say that being interested in economics and living in Argentina is like being interested in philosophy or psychology and living in a concentration camp. As Borges might say, Argentina is the Aleph. Now, working in a European central bank gives me the opportunity to gain a global perspective and learn about **international relations and macroeconomics**. It also gives me the opportunity to understand how a **developed economy** works on a daily basis. On the other hand, I have a BA in Economics and a Masters in Macroeconomics and Economic Development.
